# v4.10.1+ to v4.11.0 migration guide

The Strapi v4.10.1+ to v4.11.0 migration guide upgrades v4.10.1+ to v4.11.0.

<!-- TODO: in a few short sentences, describe what are the breaking changes in v4.11 that justify having a manuel migration guide -->

The migration guide consists of:

- Upgrading the application dependencies
<!-- TODO add additional steps specific to this migration -->
- Reinitializing the application

## Upgrading the application dependencies to 4.11.0

:::prerequisites
Stop the server before starting the upgrade.
:::

1. Upgrade all of the Strapi packages in `package.json` to `4.11.0`:

   ```json title="package.json"

   {
     // ...
     "dependencies": {
       "@strapi/strapi": "4.11.0",
       "@strapi/plugin-users-permissions": "4.11.0",
       "@strapi/plugin-i18n": "4.11.0"
       // ...
     }
   }
   ```

2. Save the edited `package.json` file.

3. Run either `yarn` or `npm install` to install the new version.

:::tip
If the operation doesn't work, try removing your `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`. If that doesn't help, remove the `node_modules` folder as well and try again.
