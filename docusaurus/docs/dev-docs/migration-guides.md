# Minor migration guides

Migrations are necessary when updating to a new Strapi version includes breaking changes. The migration guides are sequential, meaning if there is more than 1 migration guide between your current version and the latest release, follow each guide in order.

If there is no specific migration guide between your current version and the latest version, you only need to follow the [guide to update Strapi](/dev-docs/update-version).

:::caution
[Plugins extension](/dev-docs/plugins/users-permissions) that create custom code or modify existing code will need to be updated and compared to the changes in the repository. Not updating the plugin extensions could break the application.
